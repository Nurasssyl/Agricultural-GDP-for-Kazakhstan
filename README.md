I have compiled a cartogram of Kazakhstan 's agricultural GDP for 2022 .

I developed this visualization using the R programming language using the libraries: pacman, geodata, sf, terra, tidyverse, classInt, cartogram

The data is taken for 2022, and therefore there are no new divided areas on the maps

The first map is the GDP of the agricultural sector by region
The second map is the GDP of the agricultural sector by region per capita

Looking at these maps, we can draw several conclusions:
1. Kostanay and Almaty regions produce the most agricultural products, followed by Akmola and Turkestan regions.
2. North Kazakhstan region is in the lead per capita, followed by Kostanay region.
3. Agriculture per capita is noticeably underdeveloped in Central and Southern Kazakhstan.
4. On both indicators, the Mangystau region leads in terms of negative results.
